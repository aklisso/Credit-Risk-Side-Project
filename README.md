# Credit-Risk-Side-Project
This project aims to predict whether an individual has poor credit risk using ML techniques in R. The data come from the German Credit Risk data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunchawla30/german-credit-data).

Right now, this project is unfinished, but updates are added periodically to track progress!
